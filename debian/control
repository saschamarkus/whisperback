Description: send feedback using encrypted email
 WhisperBack is designed to allow Live system users to be able to report bugs
 or issues in a simple yet secure manner.
 .
 A simple graphical user interface allows sending a filled out form to
 an email address. The email is encrypted using GnuPG and sent to the
 configured SMTP relay with prior verification of its X.509
 certificate.
 .
 Please note that this package is useless without a configuration file
 that must be installed by the Live system developers.
