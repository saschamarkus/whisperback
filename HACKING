Release
=======

Install the test suite dependencies and
run the test suite:

    sudo apt install python3-gnupg && \
    ./test.py

If not done yet, import translations from Transifex
as documented on https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/#upgrade-custom-debs.

To bump the version, update the changelog, and tag the release, run:

    ./scripts/release.sh

Push:

    git push --follow-tags origin master:master

Before building the package, install an extra dependency of the clean
target, that's usually run on the host system:

    sudo apt install python3-distutils-extra
