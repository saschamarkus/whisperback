TODO
====

* Use a non-X.509-dependent way to check the SMTP relay certificate:
  fingerprint or Monkeyspher
* Fix the absolute paths and their ugly workaround
* Use the python configuration file only for the callbacks, and use the old one
  for the other configuration variables
* Change progress dialog title to "Sending email..."
* The prepended info text box uses 3 lines while 2 would be enough.
  The tails-version output should probably be chomp'ed to fix this.
* Document how to translate WhisperBack.
* Clicking on the arrow to show the included technical details makes the
  main window a bit too big for 1024x768: the About/Quit/Send buttons are
  half-hidden.
* Re-clicking the arrow to hide the included technical details doesn't
  restore the main window's original size.
